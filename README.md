# Spectre cross process (spectreXP)

This is Riverside Research's spectreXP as described in the ICCWS '22 paper:
"Transient Execution and Side Channel Analysis: a Vulnerability or a Science Experiment?"

Notes:
1. `attack` and `victim` need to be pinned to same core
2. `demo.sh` runs both attack and victim in one
3. run `make` after changing victim or attacker process to rebuild
